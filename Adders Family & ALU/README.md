# Project 2:
## Building a family of adder chips, culminating in the construction of an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
Using the chipset that I've built in the previous project, we will now proceed to build a family of adders -- chips designed to add numbers. We will then take a big step forward and build an Arithmetic Logic Unit. The ALU, which is designed to perform a whole set of arithmetic and logical operations, is the computer's calculating brain
