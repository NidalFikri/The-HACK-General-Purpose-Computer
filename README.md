# The-HACK-General-Purpose-Computer

> **What I hear, I forget; What I see, I remember; What I do, I understand.
—Confucius, 551–479 BC**

The Nand to Tetris project is about going into fascinating voyage of discovery in which I go all the way from Boolean algebra and elementary logic gates to building a **Central Processing Unit**, a memory system, and a hardware platform, leading up to a **general-purpose computer** that can run any program that you fancy. This is typically the hardware part of the overall project which relies on many sub-projects waiting to be assembled togther. 

There is no need for physical materials, since you I build the computer on my own PC, using a software-based hardware simulator, just like real computers are designed by computer engineers in the field.

In the second part of the overall project: we build a modern **software hierarchy**, designed to enable the translation and execution of object-based, high-level languages on a bare-bone computer hardware platform.In particular, I will implement a **virtual machine** and a **compiler** for a simple, Java-like programming language, and I will develop a basic **operating system** that closes gaps between the high-level language and the underlying hardware platform. In the process, gaining a deep, hands-on understanding of numerous topics in applied computer science, e.g. stack processing, parsing, code generation, and classical algorithms and data structures for memory management, vector graphics, input-output handling, and various other topics that lie at the very core of every modern computer system.

* **Hardware:** Logic gates, Boolean arithmetic, multiplexors, flip-flops, registers,
RAM units, counters, Hardware Description Language (HDL), chip simulation and
testing.
* **Architecture:** ALU/CPU design and implementation, machine code, assembly
language programming, addressing modes, memory-mapped input/output (I/O).
* **Operating systems:** Memory management, math library, basic I/O drivers,
screen management, file I/O, high-level language support.
* **Programming languages:** Object-based design and programming, abstract data
types, scoping rules, syntax and semantics, references.
* **Compilers:** Lexical analysis, top-down parsing, symbol tables, virtual stackbased
machine, code generation, implementation of arrays and objects.
* **Data structures and algorithms:** Stacks, hash tables, lists, recursion, arithmetic
algorithms, geometric algorithms, running time considerations.
* **Software engineering:** Modular design, the interface/implementation paradigm,
API design and documentation, proactive test planning, programming at the large,
quality assurance.

* 2-**Adders Family & ALU:**:heavy_check_mark: Building a family of adder chips, culminating in the construction of an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)  
* 3-**Memory Units:**:heavy_check_mark: Building registers and memory units, culminating in the construction of a Random Access Memory (RAM)  
* 4-**Machine Language:**:heavy_check_mark: Learning a machine language and using it to write some illustrative low-level programs 
* 5-**Computer Architecture & CPU:**:heavy_check_mark: Using the chipset built in projects 1-3 to build a Central Processing Unit (CPU) and a hardware platform capable of executing programs written in the machine language introduced in project 4
* 6-: Developing an assembler, i.e. a capability to translate programs written in symbolic machine language into binary, executable code.
